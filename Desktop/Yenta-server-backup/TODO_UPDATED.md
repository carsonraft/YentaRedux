## üö® CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### **High Risk Items**
1. **LinkedIn API Access**: Likely blocked - have Clearbit/Apollo backup plan
2. **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Monitor usage to avoid hitting limits
3. **Stripe Connect**: Complex setup - may need Stripe support
4. **Google Calendar**: OAuth setup can be tricky

### **Medium Risk Items**
- Database performance with large datasets
- Frontend/backend API contract mismatches
- TypeScript compilation in production build
- Authentication edge cases and security

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Mock/stub external APIs during development
- Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Regular testing of critical user paths
- Documentation of all configuration steps
